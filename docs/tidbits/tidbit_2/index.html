<p>Thesis: <em>Increasing meat consumption is unsustainable, must find suitable substitutes.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DEMAND: Health and environmental concerns push for lower meat intake. So will rising pork prices. But people still want meat-like products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SUPPLY: Traditional meat production has hit a ceiling because of land use constraints, growing pains in supply (e.g. swine fever, small scale farms), and simply because the absolute values consumed are already so high. There are (likely) hard limits to how much more China can produce.</p>

Since 2019, at least one dozen plant-based meat alternative companies have emerged.

<p>The largest impact may be not on the economy but on the environment. China has already pledged to see carbon emissions peak by 2030 and make the world’s worst polluter carbon-neutral by 2060. As livestock farming produces 20% to 50% of all man-made greenhouse gases, finding alternative protein sources is crucial to meeting these targets.</p>

Of these, Starfield, Hey Maet, Vesta and Haofood have been around for about a year; ZhenMeat was founded three years ago; and the aforementioned Green Monday is a nine-year-old Hong Kong firm pushing into mainland China.

<p><strong>Listed Agri-tech exposure</strong> - We believe China big tech platforms with their investments in the space offer an option for public market investors. Note, most of the investments have been in eGrocery or marketplace deals rather than upstream technology. While not a pure play, they could benefit from increasing meat/alt meat consumption in China. These platforms are Tencent, Pinduoduo, Alibaba, Baidu, Meituan and Didi.</p>

<p>In China, 98% of pork farms have fewer than 50 animals, and account for about a third of the country’s pork production. These highly decentralised farms make government oversight difficult. There is also enormous pressure on them to keep to the market price for pork, and to maintain steady production. The government was using ASF as a convenient excuse to eradicate these small farms, making way for centralised, industrial-scale operations.</p>
