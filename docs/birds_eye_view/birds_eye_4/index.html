<p>China VC in one chart. Count of A-rounds per year on Y-axis. Segmented by sector.
A-rounds only (A, A+, excludes preA) because in our interpretation that’s really the type
of round that signifies whether or not a sector is taking off. Anything prior to a proper
A-round (angel, seed, preA) is still quite speculative. Anything after (&gt;=B rounds) is
usually further validation of a particular company but in quantitative terms these get
fewer in the aggregate and do not really capture whether the sector is getting wind in
their sails, which is what we’re after. <em>Notice the consistently strongest sectors are:
advanced manufacturing, enterprise software, medical.</em> Other sectors have largely come and gone.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/birds_eye_view/vc2.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>Here’s the same data presented as a stacked barchart. Notice expansion of the strongest
sectors (advanced manufacturing, enterprise software, medical) in recent years, especially after 2014.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/birds_eye_view/vc3.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>Moving on to segmentation by round types. Very visibly angel rounds saw an explosion in a
frothy 2014-2016 before largely dying off.</p>
<p>As for A-rounds, these also peaked around 2014-2016 but held stronger than angel rounds
despite the drop off. Notice that while Covid-19 probably did contribute to a “capital
winter” (covered plenty in media circa 2018-19), the downtrend from the 2014 peak was well
underway before the virus. Just looking at the chart, the fall in A-rounds counts was
partly made up by BCDEFGpreIPO rounds, as investors favoured investing in existing companies
past the A-round rather than entirely new ventures. Arguably, a professionalisation of the
industry took place as angel investors phased out post 2016.</p>
<p>In recent years, the strongest performance is shown by strategic rounds. This is the only
round type that has been increasing in numbers. Arguably, in a way China’s walled garden
is dominated by “800 pound gorillas” (Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance in Internet space) and
there are fewer and fewer green pastures where entrepreneurs can get a foothold without
the backing of a strategic player (these dynamics are a longer discussion). So increasing
strategic round numbers make sense in that context.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/birds_eye_view/vc4.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>Here’s the same data presented as a stacked barchart. Again, notice the phasing out of
angel rounds and concomitant increase in strategic rounds. BCDEFGHpreIPO rounds as a
percentage of total largely same throughout.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/birds_eye_view/vc5.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>And finally, tallying up all the round types together, we get this chart. As already
discussed above, visible peak in 2015 largely driven by angel rounds. Data on round
numbers as of Oct 2021 already exceeded 2020 so arguably we are past the lows. We’ll
probably never hit the same round counts as in 2015.</p>
<p>If we had to take a gander, VC will probably experience the same that has happened to
real estate after 2016: cessation of the
large across-the-board boom-bust cycles, and dynamics becoming increasingly idiosyncratic
(in this case sector and company specific). Arguably, average round size will also increase
(data spotty so not charts unfortunately), as unrecognised green pastures and low hanging
fruit disappear amid competition, professionalisation of the VC industry, and general
maturing of China’s economy.</p>
