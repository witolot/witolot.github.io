<p>Demographics. When discussing China, it’s the elephant in the room that few are really talking about.
We get it. It’s a slow undercurrent. And human attention tends to dart towards the topics that move fast.
But it’s arguably the single biggest factor that’s going to cut across industries and define China’s
story for the next 20-30 years. Just to illustrate, how are property prices going to behave as
there are simply fewer young people to take out those mortgages
(here&rsquo;s our take in 
  <a href="https://witoldkozlowski.me/docs/big-themes/big_theme_2/">this post</a>)?
How is China’s pension system going to handle this? There’s a reason why VCs have been piling into healthcare as shown in our post 
  <a href="https://witoldkozlowski.me/docs/birds_eye_view/birds_eye_4/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/birds_eye_view/dem1.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>And China’s ageing fast. Just look at the elderly dependency ratio (chart above). <em>From the mid-2010s,
China’s ratio has accelerated and broken away from other emerging nations such as India
and Indonesia.</em></p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/birds_eye_view/dem2.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>Taking a closer look at China specifically, one can see that the population growth rate
(cyan line on chart above) actually decelerated sharply in the 1970s, well before the one-child
policy was officially announced in 1979. Presumably efforts to curb population growth
were being carried out through a collection of various policies from the early 1970s.
And as population growth decelerates, so does real urban wage growth (see purple line).
The growth story is over.</p>
<p><em>There is a reason for all that economic restructuring taking
place right now. China pre~2010 and post~2010 have to be qualitatively different by sheer
necessity of demographics.</em> The two-child policy was announced in 2016. But it’s doubtful it’s going to have much of
an impact. Looking at the chart, there’s already been a kink to the downside (cyan line) despite the
policy changes.</p>

<p>Moreover, as countries get richer, people simply stop having kids.
It gets expensive. There is a strong relationship between fertility and income across
countries. Here’s a scatterplot to illustrate the point. And China’s right at the bend (see second scatterplot).</p>

<p>Here are some projections from the UN on how China’s population decline may go.</p>
