</h1>
<p>We use an innovative alternative data set &ndash; satellite Night Time Lights (NTL) &ndash; to
quantify China&rsquo;s expansion in fixed assets (real estate, factories, infrastructure).
With the time series thus created, we get unique visibility into what has happened, when,
and where. There are a few big surprises. One, the current fixed asset expansion kicked off before Covid.
There are forces at play below the surface of the Covid narrative. Two, the sheer size of
the expansion is mind-boggling. And three, there are no positive effects felt from this
seeming boom.</p>

  <strong>The Setup</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-setup">#</a>
</h1>
<p>There is currently a lot of commotion about China’s real estate. It’s a big and complex topic.
In this two part series we’ll try to boil it down to its essence and draw out the implications.
In the first post, we deal with the supply side, quantify China’s over-expansion in fixed assets 2014-2022,
and literally pull data from space to do so. We’ll be using 
  <a href="https://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov/#about">NOAA’s Night Time Lights</a> (NTL) satellite maps. Let’s jump right in.</p>

  <strong>1. Satellite Data: Night Time Lights (NTL)</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#1-satellite-data-night-time-lights-ntl">#</a>
</h1>
<p>The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument is a component of the Suomi
National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite, a weather satellite operated by the US
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). VIIRS consists of 22 spectral bands
from the ultra-violet to the mid-infrared, one of which is able to observe night time lights (NTL).
The Wuhan map example below is the kind of visualisations can make with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The lights provide a different perspective on human settlements. We are not just looking
at where the roads are; these images are telling us when and if the roads are being used.
We are looking at human activities,” said Miguel Román, director of the Earth from Space
Institute at USRA and a principal investigator of the “Black Marble” research team. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have been studying cities around the world and how they grow and change,” Román said.
“Are they becoming more or less sustainable and livable? How do they consume energy?
When, where, and how do people move and why? Night lights give context because urbanization
is not just about a place; it is a socioeconomic, demographic, and land-use phenomenon.”

  <strong>2. Verifying the Data Set: Tesla, Rare Earths, Eastern China</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#2-verifying-the-data-set-tesla-rare-earths-eastern-china">#</a>
</h1>
<p>The NTL maps per se are publicly available but extracting data from them is fiddly at first
to get one’s head around (it took us a while). As with any alternative data set, the first
question is always <em>“How do I know that what I’m looking at is real?”</em>. Here are three bottom
up case studies to build intuition and validate the data set.</p>
<h2 id="i-tesla-shanghai-gigafactory">
  <strong>I. Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#i-tesla-shanghai-gigafactory">#</a>
</h2>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/tesla_poi.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>Tesla’s Shanghai factory is located south of the city and currently operational.
Musk broke ground for the facility back on 6th Jan 2019 (source 
  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/tesla-shanghai-factory-ground-breaking.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/tesla_sol.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>Prior to Tesla’s Gigafactory, the site was an undeveloped field. The light emissions from
the polygon containing the factory clearly show a change in 2019, as factory construction begins.
Production and its variability are seen after construction finishes. Even the Shanghai
Covid lockdown effects are seen in the extracted time series.</p>
<h2 id="ii-rare-earths-mining-facility-mountain-pass-us">
  <strong>II. Rare Earths Mining Facility, Mountain Pass (US)</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#ii-rare-earths-mining-facility-mountain-pass-us">#</a>
</h2>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/mountain_pass_poi.jpg" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>The Mountain Pass Mine, owned by MP Materials, is an open-pit mine of rare-earth elements
on the south flank of the Clark Mountain Range in California, 53 miles southwest of Las Vegas,
Nevada. In 2020 the mine supplied 15.8% of the world&rsquo;s rare-earth production. It is the only
rare-earth mining and processing facility in the United States. (Source 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Pass_mine">here</a>).</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/mountain_pass_sol.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>The mine itself went through an ownership change in the late 2010s. Originally it was owned
and operated by Molycorp, which, after going bankrupt, transferred ownership to MP Materials
who restarted operations in late 2017. The change in ownership is clearly visible in the
chart (see orange line).</p>
<h2 id="iii-china-urbanisation-in-eastern-counties">
  <strong>III. China Urbanisation in Eastern Counties</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#iii-china-urbanisation-in-eastern-counties">#</a>
</h2>
<p>So the data seems to be intuitive on small polygons of interest like factories and mining
facilities. What about when we aggregate the NTL emissions over larger areas?</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/counties.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>The map above colours in the counties of China’s Eastern provinces by NTL emission intensity.
Just from simple visual inspection, the map makes intuitive sense. Urban areas around Beijing,
Shanghai, and Shenzhen show up in dark red. The contrast between the North (orange) and the
South (yellow) also illustrates the difference in urbanisation between these regions.
All in all, this data approach using Night Time Lights (NTL) holds.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="3-china-fixed-asset-growth-by-province">
  <strong>3. China Fixed Asset Growth by Province</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#3-china-fixed-asset-growth-by-province">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Night Time Lights (NTL) picks up any and all light emissions. These can be urban real estate,
factories, mines, all the way down to infrastructure elements like roads and even lamp posts.
All of these facilities require manpower, concrete, and electricity to build and then maintain.
Conceptually then, NTL captures the presence of fixed assets in an area. It picks up on the
physical expansion of said assets, their contraction (removal or just lower utilisation),
as well as any seasonal variabilities (e.g. varying emissions between Winter and Summer).</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/regions.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>For the purposes of this analysis, we aggregate China provinces into regions. We exclude
Xinjiang and Tibet from the mapping exercise since these two provinces are  so vast that
the processing of their NTLs just kept crashing our computers.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/provinces_sol.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>We plot the end-of-month NTLs by region, add 12 month simple moving averages to smooth out
seasonality and to make it easier to read out any secular trends. The time series are
indexed to 1 for the first available data point in Jan 2014. What immediately jumps out is
that we can segment the evolution of fixed assets in China into four general phases:</p>
<p><em>1. Flat (Jan 2014 to mid-2016)</em></p>
<p>Whatever the stock level of fixed assets amassed over the years, it held more or less steady
during this time. The exception being the Western provinces, which noted a slight dip.</p>
<p><em>2. Construction push #1 (mid-2016 to Feb 2019)</em></p>
<p>A visible construction push began mid-2016 and is visible across the regions, even if its
scale differed from region to region. Just to illustrate, one can read off the chart that
Central provinces expanded their NTL emissions by 50%, going from 1 to 1.5 on the index.</p>
<p><em>3. Construction push #2 (Feb 2019 onwards)</em></p>
<p>After a visible breather towards the end of the first push when things level out for a
while, another push seems to kick off around Feb 2019 for the Eastern and Central regions.</p>
<p><em>4. Covid (Feb 2020)</em></p>
<p>For Eastern and Central regions, Covid doesn’t seem to have changed things much. Granted,
there may have been a short (few months) pause immediately after Covid, but the uptrend
continues thereafter. For Northeasterns and Western regions, however, Covid seems to indeed
have been a catalyst, as these regions only join Push #2 after its onset.</p>
<p>Overall, asset expansions occur in waves. The cooperation of property developers, construction
companies, banks, and local governments occur in tandem. Uptrends are followed by visible pauses.
Such coordination suggests policy led activity.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="4-takeaways">
  <strong>4. Takeaways</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#4-takeaways">#</a>
</h1>
<p>There are three big surprises to us at this point.</p>
<h2 id="i-the-current-expansion-push-2-really-kicked-off-before-covid">
  <strong>I. The current expansion (Push #2) really kicked off before Covid</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#i-the-current-expansion-push-2-really-kicked-off-before-covid">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Covid may indeed have been a catalyst for the less economically important regions (NE &amp; W)
but for the core regions (E &amp; C), the calculus for fixed asset expansion triggered the push
prior to Covid. There are forces at play below the surface of the Covid narrative.</p>
<h2 id="ii-the-sheer-size-of-the-expansion">
  <strong>II. The sheer size of the expansion</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#ii-the-sheer-size-of-the-expansion">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Even amid the touch-and-go of Covid lockdowns over the last 2.5 years China managed to expand
its fixed assets by an incredible amount. For instance, Central provinces went from ~1.6 to
2.1 on the index, signifying a ~30% increase. In 2.5 years.</p>
<p>That sounds crazy. But we know that the index can stay flat, as it did in 2014 to mid-2016.
We have validated it with bottom up case studies in Section 2 above. And we also know that
when Covid lockdowns hit in any particular area, these precipitate a fall in NTLs (see Wuhan
screenshot in Section 1), not an increase. And here’s the smoking gun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Property developers’ large stock of presold but unfinished housing has grown rapidly and
is nearly equivalent to the size of all private housing completed since 2015.” — 
  <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2022/04/19/global-financial-stability-report-april-2022">IMF April
2022 Global Financial Stability Report (Fig. 1.22)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the state of completion of these houses (we assume above 0% but less than 100%), construction
activity and an expansion of night lights footprints would be picked up in our NTL measures.
To us this sounds like a validation of the NTL index.</p>
<h2 id="iii-there-are-no-positive-effects-felt-from-this-seeming-boom">
  <strong>III. There are no positive effects felt from this seeming boom</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#iii-there-are-no-positive-effects-felt-from-this-seeming-boom">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Usually in the past (2010~2020), one could argue that real estate and infrastructure
construction spurred on by local governments has led to palpably (personal experience)
positive spillovers for the wider economy. Not so much this time. Either this boom just isn’t
sizeable enough in scale (again, crazy), cannot net out the negatives of the other concurrent
factors (e.g. Covid), or this modality of economic growth has simply gone way past saturation
and is no longer working. See our next post for a continuation of this analysis.</p>
