<p>The speculative boom in residential real estate may have forestalled a slowdown in 2010
but it brings with it its own set of negatives, exacerbating the deferred payment China’s
society will have to pay. A property crash at least similar in scale and economic significance
to that in the US 2007-08 is probable, possibly within a year’s time, followed by a period of
significant readjustment. One thing’s for sure — the China-after will be different to the
China-before.</p>

  <strong>The Setup</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-setup">#</a>
</h1>
<p>There is currently a lot of commotion about China’s real estate. It’s a big and complex topic.
In this two part series we’ll try to boil it down to its essence and draw out the implications.
In this post, we look at the demand side and then take a step back to put it all in context.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="1-faltering-real-estate-prices">
  <strong>1. Faltering Real Estate Prices</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#1-faltering-real-estate-prices">#</a>
</h1>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/attribution_chart.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>Here’s our visualisation of China real estate prices. The black line in the top panel is
an average of the 70 cities MoM change in price — as long as the line is above zero, prices
are growing.</p>
<p>The coloured stacked bars in the top panel are the component contributions of the various
cities, grouped by city tier (e.g. Beijing and Shanghai are Tier 1). When a city tier bar
is above the zero line that means this particular component is pulling the average up. The
reverse is also true. Visualised this way, one can see the drivers behind the changes in the
black line average. For example, in mid-2015, it was mostly Tier 1 (gold bar) pulling the
average up. Both the top and bottom panel show this but it’s visualised differently.
Personally, we love the top panel — it’s nice and clean.</p>
<p>Prices are faltering. Looking at the black line, average prices have already been below
zero for each of the last 10 months. It seems like either the willingness to take out
mortgages by homebuyers or the access to such credit is down. It may also be a simple case
of depressed incomes (underpinning of mortgage payments) versus the astronomic real estate
valuations that’s failing to keep the ball in the air. Whatever the case, bids are down.
An unwinding is in the works.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/valuations_residential.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>Here’s a chart to illustrate just how big a deal this is. It’s big. (See our 
  <a href="https://witold-work-portfolio.netlify.app/docs/big-themes/big_theme_1/">other post</a>
about the size of real estate over-expansion in China using satellite data). Any unwinding
of prices in real estate will likely at least match the magnitude and significance of the
2007 US property crash (opinion).</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/fred_us_residential.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>Now, if what is currently happening in China is really anything like the US real estate
crash of 2007, here is a potential timeline of events. Month-on-month house prices crossed
the zero line in May 2006 and the recession officially began in Jan 2008. That’s 1 year
and 9 months in between. It took a while. But it got there. Granted, we’re not the first
ones to point to China real estate and call a crash coming. However, we’ve at least provided
some timing tools, simple as they may be. And timing can be everything.</p>

<p>Now, to take a step back and put things in context.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/levy_net_investment.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>This really is the mother of all charts for China. Without getting into the technical
detail (see the 
  <a href="https://www.levyforecast.com/profits-perspective/">Profits Perspective</a>),
net gross fixed investment (i.e. any new investment beyond capital replacements) is the
driver of aggregate profitability and GDP growth in any economy (highly recommended
but technical read 
  <a href="https://www.levyforecast.com/publications/4166/sample-beijing-underestimating-developing-economic-storm/">here</a>).</p>
<p>China’s main profit engine already stalled ~2010, as can be seen from the break of the
uptrend on the chart above. That’s the end of the export led investment boom (1st golden line).
China’s auxiliary (speculative) engine is sputtering and cannot keep net fixed investment
from falling. That’s the faltering real estate boom (2nd golden line). China’s growth story
is rapidly turning into one of prolonged financial turmoil. Whatever the economic news coming
out of China today, it’s going to get much worse.</p>
<h2 id="i-main-healthy-engine-export-led-investment-boom-1970s-2010">
  <strong>I. Main (healthy) engine: Export led investment boom 1970s-2010</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#i-main-healthy-engine-export-led-investment-boom-1970s-2010">#</a>
</h2>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/trade.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>China’s main profit engine already stalled ~2010. Global demand never really recovered
after the financial crisis of 2007-2010 (see chart above). And with it, China’s trade fell.
It’s not so much that China is not an export economy anymore (arguably it still is). <em>It’s
that, starting from a small base, the wave of investment in factories and infrastructure
in support of these export related activities just petered out. Once you build all the
factories to capture global demand through trade, net fixed investment will inevitably fall.</em>
Refer to the Levy chart above and the first golden arrow.</p>
<h2 id="ii-auxiliary-speculative-engine-real-estate-boom-2010-2021">
  <strong>II. Auxiliary (speculative) engine: Real estate boom 2010-2021</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#ii-auxiliary-speculative-engine-real-estate-boom-2010-2021">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This is really where our whole real estate discussion comes in. Expansion and speculation
in real estate can indeed bring about short term benefits, namely at least a temporary
delay in the fall in aggregate net fixed investment. Refer to the Levy chart above and
the second golden arrow.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/house_affordability.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>But inevitably, speculation cannot stop the fall in net fixed investment. From an
aggregate perspective, property development by its very nature is shorter in duration
(say, ballpark, factor of x5) and less desirable than business capex. What’s worse, it
simultaneously brings with it negative side effects — notably, the astronomical house
price valuations (see house affordability chart above).</p>
<p><em>We would argue that the local government land auction system on the one hand, and the
banks’ over-willingness to underwrite mortgages at any valuation on the other, is at
fault here. The whole dynamic of land auctions being a large part of local governments’
revenue (some provinces ~50%), which gives a false sense of collateral security for both
property development underwriting and mortgage-issuing banks, which then in-effect pass
on ever increasing valuations to homebuyers, definitely has something to do with it. It
really is George Soros’ reflexivity at work here.</em></p>
<p><em>Moral hazard on the part of local governments has led to an expectation where the regular
auctioning of a finite supply of land is supposed to pay for the ongoing and increasing
governmental revenues on an indefinite basis. Of course you’re eventually going to reach
unreasonable valuations. Anecdotally, even as they have increased over the years, land
prices in general, as a percentage of the final residential property price passed on to
homebuyers went from a reasonable ~30% to massively higher (indeterminate percentage),
squeezing even developers (personal correspondence). The cost of China’s 2010-2021 growth
is arguably precisely the balance of remaining mortgage payments yet to be made.
The “soft landing” may have set the stage for something much worse.</em></p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/big_themes/dependency_ratio.png" alt="Image alt" /></p>
<p>But here’s the real show-stopper, China’s ageing fast. Just look at the elderly dependency
ratio in the chart above. From the mid-2010s, China’s ratio has accelerated and broken away
from other emerging nations such as India and Indonesia. <em>Who’s actually left to take out
those mortgages in the future? China’s demographic dividend is over.</em> And without new
incoming mortgages to prop up existing residential prices, no wonder prices are faltering.</p>

  <strong>III. Japan? 2022 and onwards</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#iii-japan-2022-and-onwards">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This really merits a whole separate post in itself. But the short version is that, given
Beijing’s historical stance, it’s more likely to replicate the post-1980s stasis of Japan
rather than the post-1970s slower growth of the US.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the reasons to doubt the soundness of Beijing’s stimulus and crisis-management
programs is that they pass much of the responsibility on to local governments and even
to private firms. This is troubling because, as Hyman Minsky argues, stabilizing a financially
unstable economy — one experiencing a macro-bubble deflation — requires a lender of last
resort and a government with effectively unlimited borrowing capacity, which can only be
the monetary authority and the central government or entity that explicitly has the full
faith and credit of the central government backing it. Passing the responsibility to local
governments, real estate development companies, and others with their own financial problems
and, in fact, pressuring them to clean up their own financial positions is not realistic.
This passing-the-buck tendency of the central government would appear to reflect the
authoritarianism of China’s leadership and its lack of understanding the difference between
forcing entities to make sacrifices and providing financial stability when facing the
threat of a vicious cycle of financial collapse. —
