When discussing China, it’s the elephant in the room that few are really talking about. We get it. It’s a slow undercurrent. And human attention tends to dart towards the topics that move fast. But it’s arguably the single biggest factor that’s going to cut across industries and define China’s story for the next 20-30 years. Just to illustrate, how are property prices going to behave as there are simply fewer young people to take out those mortgages (here\u0026rsquo;s our take in this post)? How is China’s pension system going to handle this? There’s a reason why VCs have been piling into healthcare as shown in our post here.\n And China’s ageing fast. Just look at the elderly dependency ratio (chart above). From the mid-2010s, China’s ratio has accelerated and broken away from other emerging nations such as India and Indonesia.\n Taking a closer look at China specifically, one can see that the population growth rate (cyan line on chart above) actually decelerated sharply in the 1970s, well before the one-child policy was officially announced in 1979. Presumably efforts to curb population growth were being carried out through a collection of various policies from the early 1970s. And as population growth decelerates, so does real urban wage growth (see purple line). The growth story is over.\nThere is a reason for all that economic restructuring taking place right now. China pre~2010 and post~2010 have to be qualitatively different by sheer necessity of demographics. The two-child policy was announced in 2016. But it’s doubtful it’s going to have much of an impact. Looking at the chart, there’s already been a kink to the downside (cyan line) despite the policy changes.\n  Moreover, as countries get richer, people simply stop having kids. It gets expensive. There is a strong relationship between fertility and income across countries. Here’s a scatterplot to illustrate the point. And China’s right at the bend (see second scatterplot).\n Here are some projections from the UN on how China’s population decline may go.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/big-themes/big_theme_1/","title":"China's New Real Estate Boom? Using satellite data to quantify over-expansion in fixed assets","section":"Big Themes","content":"China\u0026rsquo;s New Real Estate Boom? Using satellite data to quantify over-expansion in fixed assets #    Contents #    Satellite Data: Night Time Lights (NTL)\n  Verifying the Data Set: Tesla, Rare Earths, Eastern China\n  China Fixed Asset Growth by Province\n  Takeaways\n    Exec Summary #  We use an innovative alternative data set \u0026ndash; satellite Night Time Lights (NTL) \u0026ndash; to quantify China\u0026rsquo;s expansion in fixed assets (real estate, factories, infrastructure). With the time series thus created, we get unique visibility into what has happened, when, and where. There are a few big surprises. One, the current fixed asset expansion kicked off before Covid. There are forces at play below the surface of the Covid narrative. Two, the sheer size of the expansion is mind-boggling. And three, there are no positive effects felt from this seeming boom.\n The Setup #  There is currently a lot of commotion about China’s real estate. It’s a big and complex topic. In this two part series we’ll try to boil it down to its essence and draw out the implications. In the first post, we deal with the supply side, quantify China’s over-expansion in fixed assets 2014-2022, and literally pull data from space to do so. We’ll be using NOAA’s Night Time Lights (NTL) satellite maps. Let’s jump right in.\n 1. Satellite Data: Night Time Lights (NTL) #  The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument is a component of the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite, a weather satellite operated by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). VIIRS consists of 22 spectral bands from the ultra-violet to the mid-infrared, one of which is able to observe night time lights (NTL). The Wuhan map example below is the kind of visualisations can make with it.\n  “The lights provide a different perspective on human settlements. We are not just looking at where the roads are; these images are telling us when and if the roads are being used. We are looking at human activities,” said Miguel Román, director of the Earth from Space Institute at USRA and a principal investigator of the “Black Marble” research team. […]\n  “We have been studying cities around the world and how they grow and change,” Román said. “Are they becoming more or less sustainable and livable? How do they consume energy? When, where, and how do people move and why? Night lights give context because urbanization is not just about a place; it is a socioeconomic, demographic, and land-use phenomenon.” — NASA Earth Observatory\n  2. Verifying the Data Set: Tesla, Rare Earths, Eastern China #  The NTL maps per se are publicly available but extracting data from them is fiddly at first to get one’s head around (it took us a while). As with any alternative data set, the first question is always “How do I know that what I’m looking at is real?”. Here are three bottom up case studies to build intuition and validate the data set.\nI. Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory #   Tesla’s Shanghai factory is located south of the city and currently operational. Musk broke ground for the facility back on 6th Jan 2019 (source here).\n Prior to Tesla’s Gigafactory, the site was an undeveloped field. The light emissions from the polygon containing the factory clearly show a change in 2019, as factory construction begins. Production and its variability are seen after construction finishes. Even the Shanghai Covid lockdown effects are seen in the extracted time series.\nII. Rare Earths Mining Facility, Mountain Pass (US) #   The Mountain Pass Mine, owned by MP Materials, is an open-pit mine of rare-earth elements on the south flank of the Clark Mountain Range in California, 53 miles southwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2020 the mine supplied 15.8% of the world\u0026rsquo;s rare-earth production. It is the only rare-earth mining and processing facility in the United States. (Source here).\n The mine itself went through an ownership change in the late 2010s. Originally it was owned and operated by Molycorp, which, after going bankrupt, transferred ownership to MP Materials who restarted operations in late 2017. The change in ownership is clearly visible in the chart (see orange line).\nIII. China Urbanisation in Eastern Counties #  So the data seems to be intuitive on small polygons of interest like factories and mining facilities. What about when we aggregate the NTL emissions over larger areas?\n The map above colours in the counties of China’s Eastern provinces by NTL emission intensity. Just from simple visual inspection, the map makes intuitive sense. Urban areas around Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen show up in dark red. The contrast between the North (orange) and the South (yellow) also illustrates the difference in urbanisation between these regions. All in all, this data approach using Night Time Lights (NTL) holds.\n 3. China Fixed Asset Growth by Province #  Night Time Lights (NTL) picks up any and all light emissions. These can be urban real estate, factories, mines, all the way down to infrastructure elements like roads and even lamp posts. All of these facilities require manpower, concrete, and electricity to build and then maintain. Conceptually then, NTL captures the presence of fixed assets in an area. It picks up on the physical expansion of said assets, their contraction (removal or just lower utilisation), as well as any seasonal variabilities (e.g. varying emissions between Winter and Summer).\n For the purposes of this analysis, we aggregate China provinces into regions. We exclude Xinjiang and Tibet from the mapping exercise since these two provinces are so vast that the processing of their NTLs just kept crashing our computers.\n We plot the end-of-month NTLs by region, add 12 month simple moving averages to smooth out seasonality and to make it easier to read out any secular trends. The time series are indexed to 1 for the first available data point in Jan 2014. What immediately jumps out is that we can segment the evolution of fixed assets in China into four general phases:\n1. Flat (Jan 2014 to mid-2016)\nWhatever the stock level of fixed assets amassed over the years, it held more or less steady during this time. The exception being the Western provinces, which noted a slight dip.\n2. Construction push #1 (mid-2016 to Feb 2019)\nA visible construction push began mid-2016 and is visible across the regions, even if its scale differed from region to region. Just to illustrate, one can read off the chart that Central provinces expanded their NTL emissions by 50%, going from 1 to 1.5 on the index.\n3. Construction push #2 (Feb 2019 onwards)\nAfter a visible breather towards the end of the first push when things level out for a while, another push seems to kick off around Feb 2019 for the Eastern and Central regions.\n4. Covid (Feb 2020)\nFor Eastern and Central regions, Covid doesn’t seem to have changed things much. Granted, there may have been a short (few months) pause immediately after Covid, but the uptrend continues thereafter. For Northeasterns and Western regions, however, Covid seems to indeed have been a catalyst, as these regions only join Push #2 after its onset.\nOverall, asset expansions occur in waves. The cooperation of property developers, construction companies, banks, and local governments occur in tandem. Uptrends are followed by visible pauses. Such coordination suggests policy led activity.\n 4. Takeaways #  There are three big surprises to us at this point.\nI. The current expansion (Push #2) really kicked off before Covid #  Covid may indeed have been a catalyst for the less economically important regions (NE \u0026amp; W) but for the core regions (E \u0026amp; C), the calculus for fixed asset expansion triggered the push prior to Covid. There are forces at play below the surface of the Covid narrative.\nII. The sheer size of the expansion #  Even amid the touch-and-go of Covid lockdowns over the last 2.5 years China managed to expand its fixed assets by an incredible amount. For instance, Central provinces went from ~1.6 to 2.1 on the index, signifying a ~30% increase. In 2.5 years.\nThat sounds crazy. But we know that the index can stay flat, as it did in 2014 to mid-2016. We have validated it with bottom up case studies in Section 2 above. And we also know that when Covid lockdowns hit in any particular area, these precipitate a fall in NTLs (see Wuhan screenshot in Section 1), not an increase. And here’s the smoking gun:\n “Property developers’ large stock of presold but unfinished housing has grown rapidly and is nearly equivalent to the size of all private housing completed since 2015.” — IMF April 2022 Global Financial Stability Report (Fig. 1.22)\n Whatever the state of completion of these houses (we assume above 0% but less than 100%), construction activity and an expansion of night lights footprints would be picked up in our NTL measures. To us this sounds like a validation of the NTL index.\nIII. There are no positive effects felt from this seeming boom #  Usually in the past (2010~2020), one could argue that real estate and infrastructure construction spurred on by local governments has led to palpably (personal experience) positive spillovers for the wider economy. Not so much this time. Either this boom just isn’t sizeable enough in scale (again, crazy), cannot net out the negatives of the other concurrent factors (e.g. Covid), or this modality of economic growth has simply gone way past saturation and is no longer working. See our next post for a continuation of this analysis.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/big-themes/big_theme_2/","title":"The End of a Chapter - The bumpy road of transition ahead","section":"Big Themes","content":"The End of a Chapter: The bumpy road of transition ahead #    Contents #    Faltering Real Estate Prices\n  The Three Eras of China’s Economic Development\n  Down Memory Lane: US 2007 \u0026amp; Japan 1991\n    Exec Summary #   In recent years, Chinese gross investment has continued to look quite strong, but more and more of it has merely been to replace wearing-out or obsolescing fixed capital, and net investment — the [aggregate] profit source — has been on a long and gradual and steepening decline [from ~2010]. — “Beijing Underestimating Developing Economic Storm” Levy Forecasting Center\n After China’s export-led investment expansion ended ~2010, the speculative boom in residential real estate may have forestalled a slowdown but it brings with it its own set of negatives, exacerbating the deferred payment China’s society will have to pay. A seriously diminished role of real estate in China’s economy will force significant structural changes on all levels of society.\n The Setup #  There is currently a lot of commotion about China’s real estate. It’s a big and complex topic. In this two part series we’ll try to boil it down to its essence and draw out the implications. In this post, we look at the demand side and then take a step back to put it all in context.\n 1. Faltering Real Estate Prices #   Here’s our visualisation of China real estate prices. The black line in the top panel is an average of the 70 cities MoM change in price — as long as the line is above zero, prices are growing.\nThe coloured stacked bars in the top panel are the component contributions of the various cities, grouped by city tier (e.g. Beijing and Shanghai are Tier 1). When a city tier bar is above the zero line that means this particular component is pulling the average up. The reverse is also true. Visualised this way, one can see the drivers behind the changes in the black line average. For example, in mid-2015, it was mostly Tier 1 (gold bar) pulling the average up. Both the top and bottom panel show the same data but it’s visualised differently. Personally, we love the top panel — it’s nice and clean.\nPrices are faltering. Looking at the black line, average prices have already been below zero for each of the last 11 months. Homebuyers’ willingness to take out mortgages is down: personal mortgages as a source of funds for RE developers is down 24.4% year-over-year ( YTD figures, NBS). It may be a simple case of a depressed/slowing economy increasing uncertainty for household incomes versus the astronomic real estate valuations that’s failing to keep the ball in the air. Whatever the case, bids are down.\n Here’s a chart to illustrate just how big a deal this is. It’s big. (See also our other post about the size of real estate over-expansion in China using satellite data).\nWhat’s more, there’s a lot riding on the price of real estate:\n Housing wealth now forms a far larger share of overall Chinese assets (including stocks, securitized loans and bank lending) than it does in the United States, accounting for 78% of all assets compared to 35% for the United States — Rogoff and Yang (2020)\n Moreover, real estate related activities (e.g. construction, materials, sales, employment) make up the incomes of many people, and by extension, China’s GDP overall ( upwards of 20-30%). A faltering in such a prominent sector will no doubt have ripple effects.\n 2. The Three Eras of China’s Economic Development #  Now, to take a step back and put things in context.\n This really is the mother of all charts for China. Without getting into the technical detail (see the Profits Perspective), net gross fixed investment (i.e. any new investment beyond capital replacements) is the driver of aggregate profitability and GDP growth in any economy (highly recommended but technical read here).\nChina’s main profit engine already stalled ~2010, as can be seen from the break of the uptrend on the chart above. That’s the end of the export led investment boom (1st golden line). China’s auxiliary (speculative) engine is sputtering and cannot keep net fixed investment from falling. That’s the faltering real estate boom (2nd golden line).\nEra I: Main (healthy) engine — Export-led investment boom 1970s-2010 #   China’s main profit engine was an export-led investment boom. It’s not so much the mercantilist notion of exports driving growth, but the investment in fixed assets like factories built for exports that brought about the boom. However, while starting from a small base, the massive multi-decade wave of investment in infrastructure and factories in support of these export related activities ultimately just petered out. Once you build all the factories to capture global demand through trade, net fixed investment will inevitably fall. This can be clearly seen in the chart above with the growth in China’s merchandise exports first peaking ~1995 and then full on breaking ~2012, marking the end of Era I.\n In China’s case, the sudden opening of its vast economy as a source of cheap labor for foreign firms—and one with few onerous environmental or labor regulations or other obstacles to manufacturing and exporting—led to China’s extraordinarily rapid capture of global market share. The fact that vastly more advanced technology was immediately available made the transition even faster.\n  [… and yet,] the larger investment becomes relative to GDP, the more rapidly the economy heads toward overcapacity and toward a widespread decrease in the ability of assets to earn enough to meet the financial obligations incurred in creating or obtaining them. — “Beijing Underestimating Developing Economic Storm” Levy Forecasting Center\n Era II: Auxiliary (speculative) engine — The blow-off top in real estate that should have never been #  Here is where the whole real estate story comes in. Instead of settling for slower growth at the end of Era I, or at least finding a new healthy growth engine (harder than it sounds), China ended up opting for continued high growth through real estate speculation. While investment in real estate can indeed bring short term benefits, it’s less desirable than industrial capex, not least because of the negatives it brings with it (e.g. unaffordable housing, shorter investment duration). Not accepting slower growth from ~2010 essentially was the equivalent of not only kicking the can down the road but also making it snowball.\n A large part of the reason behind the drivers of such an outcome is the self-reinforcing cycle of perverse incentives between local governments, property developers, and households. The infamous land transfer fees are at the centre of this drama. Here is how perverse incentives created a self-reinforcing cycle:\n(1) It starts with a 1994 tax reform that incentivised local governments to increase revenue through land transfer fees.\n The tax reform introduced in 1994 had a large spillover effect on land finance in the years that followed. The reforms specified that the central government would allocate all land-related taxes to local governments…\n  This new system gave local governments a strong incentive to increase revenue from land transfers. - China’s Real Estate Problem Series 4, Liu Jing, 2022\n Land transfer fees became the major funding source for local governments (see chart above).\n(2) Local officials look good because construction activity brings jobs, GDP growth, and the revenue funds spending on social services and other obligations.\n(3) Lenders are happy as the loans made to developers are backed by the collateral of the land, whose price was determined by market processes (i.e. auction and comparable real estate sales) and property developers were highly profitable.\n(4) Developers make a bundle by intermediating between the wholesale (land purchase, construction) and retail property (standardised units in ever taller high-rises) markets. In fact, developers were further incentivised to lever up and acquire more land earlier (read: cheaper) to increase their land bank.\n(5) Households wanted to upgrade their homes from government provided shelter, providing a tailwind of real estate demand. Homebuyers gained wealth through property value increases. A wealth effect helped drive consumption, optimism in the future and even more real estate investment.\n(6) Back to (1): “Price rises for residential property subsequently increased the profits local governments made from land sales and associated taxes.” ( Liu Jing, 2022)\nIt really is George Soros' reflexivity at work here. Obtaining revenues in perpetuity from the sale of finite land can’t go on forever. Two things stand in its way: local government funding requirements and unaffordable housing.\nAnecdotally, even as they have increased over the years, land prices in general, as a percentage of the final residential property price passed on to homebuyers went from a reasonable ~30% to massively higher (indeterminate percentage), squeezing even developers, according to industry participants. The self-reinforcing loop hits a wall.\nAnd here’s the heart of today’s post. 2022 isn’t the first time when property prices have been falling — they have done so ~2012 and ~2015 as well (see very first chart). So why wouldn’t they simply continue on higher after a brief wobble as before? They might. But in the period for which we have data, it’s the first time when property prices have been falling while net fixed investment has been so low (~10% using data point from 2021). The closer to zero, the less aggregate profits available in the economy, and the more it all becomes a zero-sum game as the pie ceases to grow. From our understanding of the fundamentals, the downtrend in net fixed investment (second golden arrow) will continue, and at some point along this downtrend pain in the real estate sector will trigger a domino effect. Given all the headwinds, it may just happen in this round of faltering prices.\nEra III: Japan? 2022 and onwards #  This really merits a whole separate post in itself. But the short version is that, given Beijing’s historical stance, it’s more likely to replicate the post-1980s stasis of Japan rather than the post-1970s slower growth of the US.\n One of the reasons to doubt the soundness of Beijing’s stimulus and crisis-management programs is that they pass much of the responsibility on to local governments and even to private firms. This is troubling because, as Hyman Minsky argues, stabilizing a financially unstable economy — one experiencing a macro-bubble deflation — requires a lender of last resort and a government with effectively unlimited borrowing capacity, which can only be the monetary authority and the central government or entity that explicitly has the full faith and credit of the central government backing it. Passing the responsibility to local governments, real estate development companies, and others with their own financial problems and, in fact, pressuring them to clean up their own financial positions is not realistic. This passing-the-buck tendency of the central government would appear to reflect the authoritarianism of China’s leadership and its lack of understanding the difference between forcing entities to make sacrifices and providing financial stability when facing the threat of a vicious cycle of financial collapse. [emphasis added] — “Beijing Underestimating Developing Economic Storm” Levy Forecasting Center\n Here’s another point that merits a whole separate post by itself. (The entirety of the following argument is opinion).\nChina is arguably the greatest socio-economic experiment of our generation. It’s a culture with a storied history, which in its fundamental values hasn’t really changed since its defining Warring States Period (475–221 BCE) when many of its philosophical underpinnings were set. The concept of 士农工商 (gradated social status: government official \u0026gt; peasant \u0026gt; worker \u0026gt; merchants or businessmen) and the normative social hierarchy it thus prescribes can be seen even today, though it is often hidden by the glamour of the economic boom of the last 40 years.\nChina adopted capitalism in the 1970s partly out of desperation (socialist alternatives weren’t working to say the least) and partly as a way of maintaining social control (it’s easier to govern a country full of incentivised citizens willing to play an economic game which they feel they can win). But at the end of the day, the Chinese state only sees capitalism as a business model (no pun intended), a method, a tool, a means to an end, a way of doing things that should still be subordinate to its values and management. Capitalism, however, is an entire value system in its own right — it possesses its own underlying logic that drives its own dynamics and outcomes. It structures social hierarchies in its own way, one that is different to the one expected by the Chinese state. Neither is right nor wrong per se, it’s a value judgement.\nThere is an inherent clash coming between these two operating systems. As long as the economy was growing, things were working, and everyone was happy. A marriage of convenience. But now things are starting to be different and Beijing may be totally blind to the nature of the problems it faces. Hence the misunderstanding Levy writes about in the quote (interpretation).\n 3. Down Memory Lane: US 2007 \u0026amp; Japan 1991 #   As a reminder, it took 1 year and 9 months between property prices crossing zero growth and an official recession in the US in 2008 (see FRED chart). Whether or not China is similar in this respect is a topic for a different post.\n Here’s a chart of how the mortgage crisis worked itself out in the US. In hindsight, holding on to property through the choppy period wouldn’t have been a bad call.\n However, as a counterpoint from the universe of potential outcomes, here’s a chart for Japan. House prices never really recovered since the break of the bubble in 1991. Neither really did Japan, hence its infamous “Lost Decades”.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/birds_eye_view/birds_eye_2/","title":"Why is China Pursuing \"Common Prosperity\"?","section":"Birds Eye View","content":"Why is China Pursuing \u0026ldquo;Common Prosperity?\u0026quot; #    Contents #    Income percentiles\n  Wealth percentiles\n  Private \u0026amp; public wealth ratios\n  House affordability ratios\n  Global Gini coefficient\n  Poverty lines over time\n  China urban-rural divide\n    The Setup #  China’s leadership is advancing “Common Prosperity” as an overarching policy objective. Throughout history the Chinese state has advocated stability as a core value (interesting but dense read here: “1587, a Year of No Significance”). And the current Party likely sees recent inequality trends as threatening this stability (opinion).\nThey’re not necessarily wrong. A widely cited IMF paper (~1,200 citations) demonstrated that there is an inverse relationship between the income share accruing to the top 20% and economic growth. The study used data for 159 advanced, emerging, and developing economies for the period 1980–2012. Countries may just be easier to manage when the whole pie is growing.\nFrom the IMF:\n If the income share of the top 20 percent increases by 1 percentage point, GDP growth is actually 0.08 percentage point lower in the following five years, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. Instead, a similar increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with 0.38 percentage point higher growth. This positive relationship between disposable income shares and higher growth continues to hold for the second and third quintiles (the middle class).\n So that’s the setup. Now let’s make some charts!\n 1. Income Percentiles #  We start with a long view of the three countries for which we have the longest time series available.\n France visibly defends the bottom 50% ever since WWII. Russia is back to tsarist inequality levels with the collapse of the USSR in the 1990s. The US is clearly trending up after the Reagan reforms in the 1980s, nearing pre WWII levels.\nAnd here’s a more recent take 1970-2015 on a selected basket of countries.\n Notably, China’s bottom 20% share actually declined, whereas in many other countries it at least stayed steady.\n 2. Wealth Percentiles #  Prior to 1980s, China was equally poor. Then Deng uttered: “Let some of the people get rich first.” And that’s what happened.\n In terms of wealth ownership, China’s top 20% rockets up, especially around the 2007 financial crisis but then hits a soft ceiling in the 2010s. The inequality data only goes to 2015 and there may have been developments since then but we just don’t have the data yet.\n 3. Private \u0026amp; Public Wealth Ratios #  As most countries turn into market economies, private wealth creation follows.\n Some notable case studies. Japan’s public wealth to national income declined. Its private wealth has stayed flat ever since the start of the “lost decades”; arguably it’s a country in stasis. Norway’s public wealth to national income is probably driven by their national oil fund.\n 4. House Affordability Ratios #  Now we come to the very heart of the inequality matter for China. House affordability. It’s non-existent.\n And here’s China’s housing in context in terms of valuations:\n Most home buyers are increasingly second- or third-time purchasers.\n Home prices have been a major driver of wealth creation in China.\n Rising home prices help reduce mortgage servicing burdens, but it also prices out would be new homeowners. In China, homeownership is frequently a requirement for marriage and family formation.\nChina’s real estate sector is the centre of gravity for many issues: wealth inequality, debt, demographics.\n 5. Global Gini Coefficient #  The Gini coefficient is one of the most popular ways of measuring income inequality (0 when everybody has the same income and 1 when one person has all the income).\n However, the chart above demonstrates that behind the seeming stability of the global Gini there are things happening below the surface.\n 6. Global Gini Coefficient #  With all the talk about increasing inequality, let’s not forget that China has pulled 800 mln people out of poverty, all within its own borders.\n  7. China Urban-Rural Divide #  China’s officials place a lot of emphasis on narrowing the urban-rural divide, especially as urbanisation leaves the older generations in the countryside.\n There’s clearly a divide between the two. On a side note, rural residents are not able to sell their property or use it as collateral like the urbanites can (different policy treatment).\nWhat about percentiles for each category? Urban vs rural.\n Looking within each category, the rural population is actually more unequal in terms of income than its urban counterpart (note the bigger gap between red and green lines for rural China).\n 8. Final Thoughts #  Inequality is obviously a difficult theme to write about well. As always, our aim is to compare and contrast and look for some nuance.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/birds_eye_view/birds_eye_3/","title":"What's Changed in China's Marriage Patterns?","section":"Birds Eye View","content":"What\u0026rsquo;s Changed in China\u0026rsquo;s Marriage Patterns? #    Contents #    Hypergamy: What Is It?\n  The Reversal of a Trend\n  So What?\n    The Setup #  China has experienced unprecedented economic growth since its reforms in the 1980s. But how has this impacted its marriage patterns?\n 1. Hypergamy: What Is It? #  Hypergamy is a fancy word for the tendency in humans for men to mate across and down the socio-economic hierarchy, whereas women mate across and up. Hypergamy can be mediated through education, age, or general socio-economic status.\n You’ll notice that past a certain point on the image above, women will not partner with males of sufficiently low status. One of the reasons for why the human species evolved so rapidly is precisely due to, not just natural selection pressures which impacts all species, but to female selection. In comparison, chimpanzee females are non-discriminatory maters. More on the biology here.\nWomen are choosy of their mates along a variety of dimensions. Most notably, women prefer men with a higher capacity to: (A) generate wealth; (B) share it. This is different to men just possessing wealth because that’s ephemeral and that inheritance can be gone tomorrow. More on these studies here.\nHypergamy is a strong enough phenomenon to be observed across cultures, including arguably the most gender-equal society in the world — Norway:\n We have outlined theoretical foundations for the existence of hypergamy and we have presented overwhelming empirical evidence that hypergamy is an important feature of mating patterns in Norway. (Source: “The Economics of Hypergamy”, Almås et al. 2019)\n  2. The Reversal of a Trend? #  So what’s happened in China? Hypergamy has made a U-turn.\n  From Mu and Xie (2014):\n In the pre-reform [China] regime, almost all domains of life, including employment, consumption, housing, and even family life, were largely regulated by the state in order to operationalise Communist egalitarian ideology. Consequently, inequality was low and economic expectations were highly limited. However, the reform has dramatically altered the context. […]\n  [After the reforms] while women may want to marry older men in response to their occupational downgrades, men may want to settle down later given the labor and marriage market competition they face.\n  […] We tested the plausible ‘‘economic pressure’’ explanation that the post-1990s reform era environment – with its intensified labor market pressure, rising consumerism, and skyrocketing costs of living – acted to promote marriages of older men to younger women on the basis of a need or preference for status hypergamy. Simply put, a renewed interest in status hypergamy is thought to be driven by men’s increasing economic pressures to support family consumption and women’s downgraded labor market prospects.\n  In particular, given women’s educational advances in reform-era China, status hypergamy is more difficult to achieve among like-aged men and women, who may have similar educational attainment and be at similar career points. Our tests of the relative impact of age and education on status hypergamy support the premise that age has begun to substitute for education as a proxy for men’s higher status [emphasis added]. In this sense, our analysis found the closing of the gender gap in educational attainment to also be a plausible causal mechanism of the reversal in age homogamy in the post- 1990s reform era.\n  3. So What? #  The point is that it’s possible to quantify economic pressure across societies and time. We find that pretty neat. Others may not.\nAs a rule of thumb then, the larger the prevalence of hypergamy in a society (as exhibited in the husband-wife age gap), the greater the economic pressures (on both genders). It takes time for males to establish themselves in a society after reaching adulthood — education, skill acquisition, work experience all play into this. The more years it takes to build enough competence before being able to provide a surplus for dependents in a complex society, the higher this measure of economic pressure. We write “dependents” because no matter how you slice it, childbearing is a prolonged period of dependency for both female and child in terms of resources needed. Given that on average a single income per family isn’t sufficient even with mild hypergamy, this leads to strains on and engenders new dynamics in the whole family unit.\nIn the case of China, this trend reversed around 1995. Arguably, it’s likely that this is one of the undercurrents that’s cutting across various themes in the country, declining birth rates and unmarried low status males being just two of them.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/birds_eye_view/birds_eye_4/","title":"The History of Chinese VC in One Chart","section":"Birds Eye View","content":"The History of Chinese VC in One Chart #     China VC in one chart. Count of A-rounds per year on Y-axis. Segmented by sector. A-rounds only (A, A+, excludes preA) because in our interpretation that’s really the type of round that signifies whether or not a sector is taking off. Anything prior to a proper A-round (angel, seed, preA) is still quite speculative. Anything after (\u0026gt;=B rounds) is usually further validation of a particular company but in quantitative terms these get fewer in the aggregate and do not really capture whether the sector is getting wind in their sails, which is what we’re after. Notice the consistently strongest sectors are: advanced manufacturing, enterprise software, medical. Other sectors have largely come and gone.\n Here’s the same data presented as a stacked barchart. Notice expansion of the strongest sectors (advanced manufacturing, enterprise software, medical) in recent years, especially after 2014.\n Moving on to segmentation by round types. Very visibly angel rounds saw an explosion in a frothy 2014-2016 before largely dying off.\nAs for A-rounds, these also peaked around 2014-2016 but held stronger than angel rounds despite the drop off. Notice that while Covid-19 probably did contribute to a “capital winter” (covered plenty in media circa 2018-19), the downtrend from the 2014 peak was well underway before the virus. Just looking at the chart, the fall in A-rounds counts was partly made up by BCDEFGpreIPO rounds, as investors favoured investing in existing companies past the A-round rather than entirely new ventures. Arguably, a professionalisation of the industry took place as angel investors phased out post 2016.\nIn recent years, the strongest performance is shown by strategic rounds. This is the only round type that has been increasing in numbers. Arguably, in a way China’s walled garden is dominated by “800 pound gorillas” (Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance in Internet space) and there are fewer and fewer green pastures where entrepreneurs can get a foothold without the backing of a strategic player (these dynamics are a longer discussion). So increasing strategic round numbers make sense in that context.\n Here’s the same data presented as a stacked barchart. Again, notice the phasing out of angel rounds and concomitant increase in strategic rounds. BCDEFGHpreIPO rounds as a percentage of total largely same throughout.\n And finally, tallying up all the round types together, we get this chart. As already discussed above, visible peak in 2015 largely driven by angel rounds. Data on round numbers as of Oct 2021 already exceeded 2020 so arguably we are past the lows. We’ll probably never hit the same round counts as in 2015.\nIf we had to take a gander, VC will probably experience the same that has happened to real estate after 2016: cessation of the large across-the-board boom-bust cycles, and dynamics becoming increasingly idiosyncratic (in this case sector and company specific). Arguably, average round size will also increase (data spotty so not charts unfortunately), as unrecognised green pastures and low hanging fruit disappear amid competition, professionalisation of the VC industry, and general maturing of China’s economy.\n"}]
