Using satellite data to quantify over-expansion in fixed assets #    Contents #    Satellite Data: Night Time Lights (NTL)\n  Verifying the Data Set: Tesla, Rare Earths, Eastern China\n  China Fixed Asset Growth by Province\n  Takeaways\n    Why You Should Read This Post #  We use an innovative alternative data set \u0026ndash; satellite Night Time Lights (NTL) \u0026ndash; to quantify China\u0026rsquo;s expansion in fixed assets (real estate, factories, infrastructure). With the time series thus created, we get unique visibility into what has happened, when, and where. There are a few big surprises. One, the current fixed asset expansion kicked off before Covid. There are forces at play below the surface of the Covid narrative. Two, the sheer size of the expansion is mind-boggling. And three, there are no positive effects felt from this seeming boom.\n The Setup #  There is currently a lot of commotion about China’s real estate. It’s a big and complex topic. In this two part series we’ll try to boil it down to its essence and draw out the implications. In the first post, we deal with the supply side, quantify China’s over-expansion in fixed assets 2014-2022, and literally pull data from space to do so. We’ll be using NOAA’s Night Time Lights (NTL) satellite maps. Let’s jump right in.\n 1. Satellite Data: Night Time Lights (NTL) #  The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument is a component of the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite, a weather satellite operated by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). VIIRS consists of 22 spectral bands from the ultra-violet to the mid-infrared, one of which is able to observe night time lights (NTL). The Wuhan map example below is the kind of visualisations can make with it.\n  “The lights provide a different perspective on human settlements. We are not just looking at where the roads are; these images are telling us when and if the roads are being used. We are looking at human activities,” said Miguel Román, director of the Earth from Space Institute at USRA and a principal investigator of the “Black Marble” research team. […]\n  “We have been studying cities around the world and how they grow and change,” Román said. “Are they becoming more or less sustainable and livable? How do they consume energy? When, where, and how do people move and why? Night lights give context because urbanization is not just about a place; it is a socioeconomic, demographic, and land-use phenomenon.” — NASA Earth Observatory\n  2. Verifying the Data Set: Tesla, Rare Earths, Eastern China #  The NTL maps per se are publicly available but extracting data from them is fiddly at first to get one’s head around (it took us a while). As with any alternative data set, the first question is always “How do I know that what I’m looking at is real?”. Here are three bottom up case studies to build intuition and validate the data set.\nI. Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory #   Tesla’s Shanghai factory is located south of the city and currently operational. Musk broke ground for the facility back on 6th Jan 2019 (source here).\n Prior to Tesla’s Gigafactory, the site was an undeveloped field. The light emissions from the polygon containing the factory clearly show a change in 2019, as factory construction begins. Production and its variability are seen after construction finishes. Even the Shanghai Covid lockdown effects are seen in the extracted time series.\nII. Rare Earths Mining Facility, Mountain Pass (US) #   The Mountain Pass Mine, owned by MP Materials, is an open-pit mine of rare-earth elements on the south flank of the Clark Mountain Range in California, 53 miles southwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2020 the mine supplied 15.8% of the world\u0026rsquo;s rare-earth production. It is the only rare-earth mining and processing facility in the United States. (Source here).\n The mine itself went through an ownership change in the late 2010s. Originally it was owned and operated by Molycorp, which, after going bankrupt, transferred ownership to MP Materials who restarted operations in late 2017. The change in ownership is clearly visible in the chart (see orange line).\nIII. China Urbanisation in Eastern Counties #  So the data seems to be intuitive on small polygons of interest like factories and mining facilities. What about when we aggregate the NTL emissions over larger areas?\n The map above colours in the counties of China’s Eastern provinces by NTL emission intensity. Just from simple visual inspection, the map makes intuitive sense. Urban areas around Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen show up in dark red. The contrast between the North (orange) and the South (yellow) also illustrates the difference in urbanisation between these regions. All in all, this data approach using Night Time Lights (NTL) holds.\n 3. China Fixed Asset Growth by Province #  Night Time Lights (NTL) picks up any and all light emissions. These can be urban real estate, factories, mines, all the way down to infrastructure elements like roads and even lamp posts. All of these facilities require manpower, concrete, and electricity to build and then maintain. Conceptually then, NTL captures the presence of fixed assets in an area. It picks up on the physical expansion of said assets, their contraction (removal or just lower utilisation), as well as any seasonal variabilities (e.g. varying emissions between Winter and Summer).\n For the purposes of this analysis, we aggregate China provinces into regions. We exclude Xinjiang and Tibet from the mapping exercise since these two provinces are so vast that the processing of their NTLs just kept crashing our computers.\n We plot the end-of-month NTLs by region, add 12 month simple moving averages to smooth out seasonality and to make it easier to read out any secular trends. The time series are indexed to 1 for the first available data point in Jan 2014. What immediately jumps out is that we can segment the evolution of fixed assets in China into four general phases:\n1. Flat (Jan 2014 to mid-2016)\nWhatever the stock level of fixed assets amassed over the years, it held more or less steady during this time. The exception being the Western provinces, which noted a slight dip.\n2. Construction push #1 (mid-2016 to Feb 2019)\nA visible construction push began mid-2016 and is visible across the regions, even if its scale differed from region to region. Just to illustrate, one can read off the chart that Central provinces expanded their NTL emissions by 50%, going from 1 to 1.5 on the index.\n3. Construction push #2 (Feb 2019 onwards)\nAfter a visible breather towards the end of the first push when things level out for a while, another push seems to kick off around Feb 2019 for the Eastern and Central regions.\n4. Covid (Feb 2020)\nFor Eastern and Central regions, Covid doesn’t seem to have changed things much. Granted, there may have been a short (few months) pause immediately after Covid, but the uptrend continues thereafter. For Northeasterns and Western regions, however, Covid seems to indeed have been a catalyst, as these regions only join Push #2 after its onset.\nOverall, asset expansions occur in waves. The cooperation of property developers, construction companies, banks, and local governments occur in tandem. Uptrends are followed by visible pauses. Such coordination suggests policy led activity.\n 4. Takeaways #  There are three big surprises to us at this point.\nI. The current expansion (Push #2) really kicked off before Covid #  Covid may indeed have been a catalyst for the less economically important regions (NE \u0026amp; W) but for the core regions (E \u0026amp; C), the calculus for fixed asset expansion triggered the push prior to Covid. There are forces at play below the surface of the Covid narrative.\nII. The sheer size of the expansion #  Even amid the touch-and-go of Covid lockdowns over the last 2.5 years China managed to expand its fixed assets by an incredible amount. For instance, Central provinces went from ~1.6 to 2.1 on the index, signifying a ~30% increase. In 2.5 years.\nThat sounds crazy. But we know that the index can stay flat, as it did in 2014 to mid-2016. We have validated it with bottom up case studies in Section 2 above. And we also know that when Covid lockdowns hit in any particular area, these precipitate a fall in NTLs (see Wuhan screenshot in Section 1), not an increase. And here’s the smoking gun:\n “Property developers’ large stock of presold but unfinished housing has grown rapidly and is nearly equivalent to the size of all private housing completed since 2015.” — IMF April 2022 Global Financial Stability Report (Fig. 1.22)\n Whatever the state of completion of these houses (we assume above 0% but less than 100%), construction activity and an expansion of night lights footprints would be picked up in our NTL measures. To us this sounds like a validation of the NTL index.\nIII. There are no positive effects felt from this seeming boom #  Usually in the past (2010~2020), one could argue that real estate and infrastructure construction spurred on by local governments has led to palpably (personal experience) positive spillovers for the wider economy. Not so much this time. Either this boom just isn’t sizeable enough in scale (again, crazy), cannot net out the negatives of the other concurrent factors (e.g. Covid), or this modality of economic growth has simply gone way past saturation and is no longer working. See our next post for a continuation of this analysis.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/quant/quant_1/","title":"From Consumer Complaints to Investment Alpha for US Financial Companies","section":"Quant","content":"From Consumer Complaints to Investment Alpha for US Financial Companies #    Contents #    Data Sourcing\n  Feature Selection\n  Textual Analysis\n  Deriving Variables\n  Quantile Segmentation\n  Plotting Portfolio Performance\n   *Not investment advice. Do your own research.   Why You Should Read This Post #  There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of data out there. But most people think it only has to be numeric. The exercise herein is really about whether one can turn text itself into actionable data. And since we prove below that we can, this unlocks a whole new world of possibilities for extracting alpha from text sources. Consumer complaints, filings like 10-Ks, or even analyst reports themselves (i.e. parse the text of analyst reports, not the data they use, to build second order databases) can become actionable data.\n Exec Summary #  Can publicly available data on consumer complaints be reworked in such a way as to generate discernible alpha in investment returns? Turns out that yes. Here are the portfolio results.\n Specifically, we use the publicly available Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) Complaints Database. We tie the data to a universe of 25 publicly traded US consumer facing financial institutions. We extract features from the data and derive variables using textual analysis of the consumer complaint narratives.\nThe derived variable is year-on-year similarity / change score in the consumer complaint narratives. The main idea is that if the complaints a company receives change year on year, this means something. In this case, it turns out that companies with the largest change (i.e. changers) in their complaints outperform non-changers. Inspecting the differences visually, it’s clearly visible that Portfolio Q1 performed worst and Q5 second best. The 130/30 long-short portfolio is best.\n*change_score = 1 - similarity_score\n 1. Data Sourcing #  We use the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) Complaints Database. These are complaints made against financial products of particular companies (e.g. credit scoring, credit cards, loans). The database updates daily.\n 2. Feature Selection #  We’re mostly interested in the “Consumer complaint narrative” column, which contains unstructured text. While the database goes back to 2011, these consumer narratives only become available from 2015, giving us 7 years of data (Jan 2015 - Dec 2021) with a total of 841,219 non-empty entries (consumers elect whether to disclose their narrative).\n Since not all companies which receive complaints are publicly traded, for the purpose of this exercise we’ll just peel the top 25 from the top and ticker tie them later in the workflow.\n  3. Textual Analysis #  Now we run the textual analysis:\n  Convert dataframe to corpus format\n  Make tokens out of the words\n  Remove stop words (e.g. “a”, “the”)\n  Stem the words (e.g. so we count “fraudulent” and “fraud” as same since stem would be “fraud”)\n  Just for demonstration purposes, after all this data wrangling we can run a word cloud visualisation. In this case we’re comparing across companies for 2021.\n And here’s a word cloud across time for the same company, Wells Fargo.\n For building intuition, we can also run a lexical dispersion plot for particular keywords that may be relevant in the financial context. In this case we plot “fraud”, “identity”, “violat*” for Wells Fargo by year.\n  4. Deriving Variables #  Here’s the key part. We want to calculate the similarity of each Company-Year’s worth of complaints to one another. E.g. We compare Wells Fargo complaints from 2021 to Wells Fargo complaints from 2020 using a similarity score for each year.\nHere’s a visualisation of the similarity score (i.e. derived variable). A score of 1 means that the nature of this year’s versus the previous year’s complaints is identical. The closer to zero, the more different is one Company-Year to another. By definition then: 1 - similarity_score = change_score.\n Going further, we can plot company migration through time and quantiles like so:\n  5. Quantile Segmentation #  To prepare the similarity score for testing, we need to:\n  Rank companies by their similarity score by year\n  Assign these to quintiles\n  Create portfolio weights\n  Run calculations and plot the portfolios\n  Here’s a visualisation of the weights. Since we have 25 stocks in our universe, a quintile will be 5 stocks. Within each quintile, each stock will take a 20% weighting.\n And here’s a visualisation of the Q5-Q1 portfolio weight. This is a long-short portfolio. Long the stocks from the favoured quintile and short the stocks from the disfavoured quintile. The favoured quintile was then weighted at 130 and the disfavoured at 30 to give a 130/30 allocation. Notice that the long stocks sum to above 1.00 and the short stocks have negative weights and sum to -1/3.\n  6. Plotting Portfolio Performance #  Here are the resulting portfolios for each quintile. Inspecting the differences visually, it’s clear that Portfolio Q1 performed worst and Q5 second best. The 130/30 long-short portfolio is best.\n "},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/tidbits/tidbit_1/","title":"Why is China Pursuing \"Common Prosperity\"?","section":"Tidbits","content":"Why is China Pursuing \u0026ldquo;Common Prosperity?\u0026quot; #    Contents #    Income percentiles\n  Wealth percentiles\n  Private \u0026amp; public wealth ratios\n  House affordability ratios\n  Global Gini coefficient\n  Poverty lines over time\n  China urban-rural divide\n    The Setup #  China’s leadership is advancing “Common Prosperity” as an overarching policy objective. Throughout history the Chinese state has advocated stability as a core value (interesting but dense read here: “1587, a Year of No Significance”). And the current Party likely sees recent inequality trends as threatening this stability (opinion).\nThey’re not necessarily wrong. A widely cited IMF paper (~1,200 citations) demonstrated that there is an inverse relationship between the income share accruing to the top 20% and economic growth. The study used data for 159 advanced, emerging, and developing economies for the period 1980–2012. Countries may just be easier to manage when the whole pie is growing.\nFrom the IMF:\n If the income share of the top 20 percent increases by 1 percentage point, GDP growth is actually 0.08 percentage point lower in the following five years, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. Instead, a similar increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with 0.38 percentage point higher growth. This positive relationship between disposable income shares and higher growth continues to hold for the second and third quintiles (the middle class).\n So that’s the setup. Now let’s make some charts!\n 1. Income Percentiles #  We start with a long view of the three countries for which we have the longest time series available.\n France visibly defends the bottom 50% ever since WWII. Russia is back to tsarist inequality levels with the collapse of the USSR in the 1990s. The US is clearly trending up after the Reagan reforms in the 1980s, nearing pre WWII levels.\nAnd here’s a more recent take 1970-2015 on a selected basket of countries.\n Notably, China’s bottom 20% share actually declined, whereas in many other countries it at least stayed steady.\n 2. Wealth Percentiles #  Prior to 1980s, China was equally poor. Then Deng uttered: “Let some of the people get rich first.” And that’s what happened.\n In terms of wealth ownership, China’s top 20% rockets up, especially around the 2007 financial crisis but then hits a soft ceiling in the 2010s. The inequality data only goes to 2015 and there may have been developments since then but we just don’t have the data yet.\n 3. Private \u0026amp; Public Wealth Ratios #  As most countries turn into market economies, private wealth creation follows.\n Some notable case studies. Japan’s public wealth to national income declined. Its private wealth has stayed flat ever since the start of the “lost decades”; arguably it’s a country in stasis. Norway’s public wealth to national income is probably driven by their national oil fund.\n 4. House Affordability Ratios #  Now we come to the very heart of the inequality matter for China. House affordability. It’s non-existent.\n And here’s China’s housing in context in terms of valuations:\n Most home buyers are increasingly second- or third-time purchasers.\n Home prices have been a major driver of wealth creation in China.\n Rising home prices help reduce mortgage servicing burdens, but it also prices out would be new homeowners. In China, homeownership is frequently a requirement for marriage and family formation.\nChina’s real estate sector is the centre of gravity for many issues: wealth inequality, debt, demographics.\n 5. Global Gini Coefficient #  The Gini coefficient is one of the most popular ways of measuring income inequality (0 when everybody has the same income and 1 when one person has all the income).\n However, the chart above demonstrates that behind the seeming stability of the global Gini there are things happening below the surface.\n 6. Global Gini Coefficient #  With all the talk about increasing inequality, let’s not forget that China has pulled 800 mln people out of poverty, all within its own borders.\n  7. China Urban-Rural Divide #  China’s officials place a lot of emphasis on narrowing the urban-rural divide, especially as urbanisation leaves the older generations in the countryside.\n There’s clearly a divide between the two. On a side note, rural residents are not able to sell their property or use it as collateral like the urbanites can (different policy treatment).\nWhat about percentiles for each category? Urban vs rural.\n Looking within each category, the rural population is actually more unequal in terms of income than its urban counterpart (note the bigger gap between red and green lines for rural China).\n 8. Final Thoughts #  Inequality is obviously a difficult theme to write about well. As always, our aim is to compare and contrast and look for some nuance.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/big-themes/big_theme_2/","title":"It's Coming - A property crash similar in scale and economic significance to that in the US 2007-08","section":"Big Themes","content":"It\u0026rsquo;s Coming: A property crash similar in scale and economic significance to that in the US 2007-08 #    Contents #    Faltering Real Estate Prices\n  The Three Eras of China’s Economic Development\n  Takeaways\n    Why You Should Read This Post #   In recent years, Chinese gross investment has continued to look quite strong, but more and more of it has merely been to replace wearing-out or obsolescing fixed capital, and net investment — the [aggregate] profit source — has been on a long and gradual and steepening decline [from ~2010]. — Levy Forecasting Center\n The speculative boom in residential real estate may have forestalled a slowdown in 2010 but it brings with it its own set of negatives, exacerbating the deferred payment China’s society will have to pay. A property crash at least similar in scale and economic significance to that in the US 2007-08 is probable, possibly within a year’s time, followed by a period of significant readjustment. One thing’s for sure — the China-after will be different to the China-before.\n The Setup #  There is currently a lot of commotion about China’s real estate. It’s a big and complex topic. In this two part series we’ll try to boil it down to its essence and draw out the implications. In this post, we look at the demand side and then take a step back to put it all in context.\n 1. Faltering Real Estate Prices #   Here’s our visualisation of China real estate prices. The black line in the top panel is an average of the 70 cities MoM change in price — as long as the line is above zero, prices are growing.\nThe coloured stacked bars in the top panel are the component contributions of the various cities, grouped by city tier (e.g. Beijing and Shanghai are Tier 1). When a city tier bar is above the zero line that means this particular component is pulling the average up. The reverse is also true. Visualised this way, one can see the drivers behind the changes in the black line average. For example, in mid-2015, it was mostly Tier 1 (gold bar) pulling the average up. Both the top and bottom panel show this but it’s visualised differently. Personally, we love the top panel — it’s nice and clean.\nPrices are faltering. Looking at the black line, average prices have already been below zero for each of the last 10 months. It seems like either the willingness to take out mortgages by homebuyers or the access to such credit is down. It may also be a simple case of depressed incomes (underpinning of mortgage payments) versus the astronomic real estate valuations that’s failing to keep the ball in the air. Whatever the case, bids are down. An unwinding is in the works.\n Here’s a chart to illustrate just how big a deal this is. It’s big. (See our other post about the size of real estate over-expansion in China using satellite data). Any unwinding of prices in real estate will likely at least match the magnitude and significance of the 2007 US property crash (opinion).\n Now, if what is currently happening in China is really anything like the US real estate crash of 2007, here is a potential timeline of events. Month-on-month house prices crossed the zero line in May 2006 and the recession officially began in Jan 2008. That’s 1 year and 9 months in between. It took a while. But it got there. Granted, we’re not the first ones to point to China real estate and call a crash coming. However, we’ve at least provided some timing tools, simple as they may be. And timing can be everything.\n 2. The Three Eras of China’s Economic Development #  Now, to take a step back and put things in context.\n This really is the mother of all charts for China. Without getting into the technical detail (see the Profits Perspective), net gross fixed investment (i.e. any new investment beyond capital replacements) is the driver of aggregate profitability and GDP growth in any economy (highly recommended but technical read here).\nChina’s main profit engine already stalled ~2010, as can be seen from the break of the uptrend on the chart above. That’s the end of the export led investment boom (1st golden line). China’s auxiliary (speculative) engine is sputtering and cannot keep net fixed investment from falling. That’s the faltering real estate boom (2nd golden line). China’s growth story is rapidly turning into one of prolonged financial turmoil. Whatever the economic news coming out of China today, it’s going to get much worse.\nI. Main (healthy) engine: Export led investment boom 1970s-2010 #   China’s main profit engine already stalled ~2010. Global demand never really recovered after the financial crisis of 2007-2010 (see chart above). And with it, China’s trade fell. It’s not so much that China is not an export economy anymore (arguably it still is). It’s that, starting from a small base, the wave of investment in factories and infrastructure in support of these export related activities just petered out. Once you build all the factories to capture global demand through trade, net fixed investment will inevitably fall. Refer to the Levy chart above and the first golden arrow.\nII. Auxiliary (speculative) engine: Real estate boom 2010-2021 #  This is really where our whole real estate discussion comes in. Expansion and speculation in real estate can indeed bring about short term benefits, namely at least a temporary delay in the fall in aggregate net fixed investment. Refer to the Levy chart above and the second golden arrow.\n But inevitably, speculation cannot stop the fall in net fixed investment. From an aggregate perspective, property development by its very nature is shorter in duration (say, ballpark, factor of x5) and less desirable than business capex. What’s worse, it simultaneously brings with it negative side effects — notably, the astronomical house price valuations (see house affordability chart above).\nWe would argue that the local government land auction system on the one hand, and the banks’ over-willingness to underwrite mortgages at any valuation on the other, is at fault here. The whole dynamic of land auctions being a large part of local governments’ revenue (some provinces ~50%), which gives a false sense of collateral security for both property development underwriting and mortgage-issuing banks, which then in-effect pass on ever increasing valuations to homebuyers, definitely has something to do with it. It really is George Soros’ reflexivity at work here.\nMoral hazard on the part of local governments has led to an expectation where the regular auctioning of a finite supply of land is supposed to pay for the ongoing and increasing governmental revenues on an indefinite basis. Of course you’re eventually going to reach unreasonable valuations. Anecdotally, even as they have increased over the years, land prices in general, as a percentage of the final residential property price passed on to homebuyers went from a reasonable ~30% to massively higher (indeterminate percentage), squeezing even developers (personal correspondence). The cost of China’s 2010-2021 growth is arguably precisely the balance of remaining mortgage payments yet to be made. The “soft landing” may have set the stage for something much worse.\n But here’s the real show-stopper, China’s ageing fast. Just look at the elderly dependency ratio in the chart above. From the mid-2010s, China’s ratio has accelerated and broken away from other emerging nations such as India and Indonesia. Who’s actually left to take out those mortgages in the future? China’s demographic dividend is over. And without new incoming mortgages to prop up existing residential prices, no wonder prices are faltering.\nIII. Japan? 2022 and onwards #  This really merits a whole separate post in itself. But the short version is that, given Beijing’s historical stance, it’s more likely to replicate the post-1980s stasis of Japan rather than the post-1970s slower growth of the US.\n One of the reasons to doubt the soundness of Beijing’s stimulus and crisis-management programs is that they pass much of the responsibility on to local governments and even to private firms. This is troubling because, as Hyman Minsky argues, stabilizing a financially unstable economy — one experiencing a macro-bubble deflation — requires a lender of last resort and a government with effectively unlimited borrowing capacity, which can only be the monetary authority and the central government or entity that explicitly has the full faith and credit of the central government backing it. Passing the responsibility to local governments, real estate development companies, and others with their own financial problems and, in fact, pressuring them to clean up their own financial positions is not realistic. This passing-the-buck tendency of the central government would appear to reflect the authoritarianism of China’s leadership and its lack of understanding the difference between forcing entities to make sacrifices and providing financial stability when facing the threat of a vicious cycle of financial collapse. — Levy Forecasting Center\n "},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/quant/quant_2/","title":"Satellite Night Time Lights (NTL) as Investment Signal for Indian Cement Stocks","section":"Quant","content":"Satellite Night Time Lights (NTL) as Investment Signal for Indian Cement Stocks #    Contents #    Indian Cement Plants\n  Satellite Night Time Lights (NTL)\n  Tying Night Time Lights to Stock Performance\n   *Not investment advice.

Maps: Night time lights: NASA BlackMarble; Plant ownership data: Spatial Finance Institute.\n We first take a subset of all cement plants globally and focus only on those that are listed on the Indian NSI stock exchange. There is a number of plants operating in India that are not publicly listed. So our India subset is also a subset of total Indian production. When we map them out spatially, we get the map above. Some Indian companies own plants abroad.\n Above is a list of Indian cement companies ranked by the number of plants they operate. ULTRACEMCO operates the most plants.\n 2. Satellite Night Time Lights (NTL) #   For a detailed write up about what Night Time Lights (NTL) are and how we validate the data set they provide, go to the post here. As a quick recap, here is a satellite image of Wuhan before and after the onset of Covid (see above). The NTL emissions are visibly lower after onset.\n We now take all the Indian cement plants and aggregate their individual time series. In the chart above, one can see total India cement production. Notice the very clear seasonality, corroborated qualitatively in this article here.\n Now we perform the same aggregation exercise but instead of nationally we segment by plant owner (chart above). One can see that some are trending up, some are trending down, some are larger, some are smaller on average. Some visibly have some stop-and-go activity going on (e.g. MURLIIND).\n 3.

Do your own research.   1. China Meat Consumption #  Comparatively per capita, China consumes an average amount of meat, mostly pork.\n In absolute terms (tonnes of meat consumed), no other country’s even close. It’s ridiculous.\n  2. China Meat Production #  China’s per capita meat production has hit some snags. Y-axis is kg/capita/year.\n Cost of protein. Beef cannot make up for shortfalls in protein production for one reason: land constraints. It’s going to be either pork or poultry. Asia has way too many people on too little land.\n  3. Trade Idea: Long Alternative Meat #  Thesis: Increasing meat consumption is unsustainable, must find suitable substitutes.\n  DEMAND: Health and environmental concerns push for lower meat intake. So will rising pork prices. But people still want meat-like products.\n  SUPPLY: Traditional meat production has hit a ceiling because of land use constraints, growing pains in supply (e.g. swine fever, small scale farms), and simply because the absolute values consumed are already so high. There are (likely) hard limits to how much more China can produce.\n  Listed companies with Alternative Meat exposure #    Beyond Meat (BYND US) - Develops plant based protein food products and opened its first international factory in Jiaxing, China this year. In 2020, Beyond Meat\u0026rsquo;s revenues were US$406.8 million, up 36.6% from 2019. International sales were 20% of 2020 sales and declined 16.5% from 2019 levels. Beyond Meat has yet to earn a profit and trades at US$4.9 billion market cap, or about 7.4 times 2022 sales estimates.\n  AgriNurture Inc (ANI PM) - A Philippine agricultural company that exports fresh product and processed foods, including plant based meat. They are launching new plant based meat products under the name \u0026ldquo;Fit Bites.\u0026rdquo; AgriNurture also engages in Real Estate development in China. Their 2020 revenues were PHP 4.4 billion, about 52% were earned in Hong Kong/China. 2020 net sales declined 2.8% from 2019 levels. AgriNurture\u0026rsquo;s market cap is PHP 6.6 billion.\n  Further reading #    USDA on plant based alt-meat trends in China (includes list of companies)   In the past few years, driven by novelty and perceived health benefits, consumers have become interested in plant-based meat alternatives […]\n  Most domestic plant-based meat alternative companies are start-up businesses that are using venture capital funding to innovate and expand revenue. Since 2019, at least one dozen plant-based meat alternative companies have emerged. Most domestic companies are focused on reaching consumers first through the restaurant industry, while a few are exploring direct-to-consumer sales models, especially growing e-commerce sales for at-home consumption and snack foods.\n   Vegan meat market in China - analysis by local consultancy   […] the times are changing and younger Chinese are noticing the negative side of eating an abundance of meat. Nowadays, health and weight concerns are among the main reasons why Chinese people reduce their meat intake […]\n  Today’s biggest producers and suppliers of alternative meat are situated in Europe and North America.\n  […] in the last 5 years numerous plant-based raw ingredients providers have sprung up in China, thanks to investment and incubator programs.\n   Time article on meat in China   The buzz around Green Common is another sign that China is on the cusp of a plant-based-protein revolution that has investors as well as diners licking their lips.\n  The largest impact may be not on the economy but on the environment. China has already pledged to see carbon emissions peak by 2030 and make the world’s worst polluter carbon-neutral by 2060. As livestock farming produces 20% to 50% of all man-made greenhouse gases, finding alternative protein sources is crucial to meeting these targets.\n   TechCrunch article on alt-meat Chinese startups   2020 could well have been the dawn of alternative protein in China. More than 10 startups raised capital to make plant-based protein for a country with increasing meat demand. Of these, Starfield, Hey Maet, Vesta and Haofood have been around for about a year; ZhenMeat was founded three years ago; and the aforementioned Green Monday is a nine-year-old Hong Kong firm pushing into mainland China. The competition intensified further last year when American incumbents Beyond Meat and Eat Just entered China.\n   Beyond Meat opens China factory, its first outside US   [Beyond Meat] will churn out variations on Beyond Pork, which the company described as its “first innovation created specifically for the Chinese market.”\n  4. Trade Idea: Long Agri-tech / Animal health #  Thesis: Demand for meat will continue to grow. This can be met by technological supply-side solutions.\n  DEMAND: People won’t stop eating meat. Especially as urbanisation continues. And they (largely) will not accept meat substitutes.\n  SUPPLY: Animal health (biotech) and productivity efficiency gains (smart agri-tech) in meat production can solve current supply issues.\n  Listed companies with Animal Health exposure #    Jinyu Bio-Technology (600201 CH) - 2020 sales of CNY 1.58 billion, up 40% from 2019. Jinyu is in the animal disease prevention and control business. They provide veterinary biologic products covering pigs, poultry, ruminants and pets of more than 100 kinds of animal vaccines. Jinyu’s market cap is CNY 18.5 billion, 21.6 times 2022 consensus earnings.\n  China Animal Husbandry (600195 CH) - 2020 sales of CNY 5.0 billion, up 20.9% from 2019. CAH engages in the research and development, production, sale, and service of animal health and nutrition products. CAH’s market cap is CNY 11.75 billion, 18.4 times 2022 consensus earnings.\n  Zoetis Inc (ZTS US) - Zoetis is a global leader in animal health with US$6.67 billion in 2020 sales (up 7.8% from 2019). They focus on vaccines, other animal pharmaceuticals, anti-infectives, parasiticides, medicated feed additives, animal health diagnostics both to livestock and companion animals. Since 2019 over 50% of their revenue comes from companion animals. In 2020 Zoetis increased their sales in China by 33% to US$266 million, 50% of which was livestock. Zoetis has an R\u0026amp;D center in Beijing, a R\u0026amp;D+ manufacturing in Suzhou, Jiangsu and plants in Tonghua, Jilin and Suzhou, Jiangsu. Currently, Zoetis is building a second manufacturing plant in Suzhou. Zoetis market cap is USD 107 billion, 44 times 2022 consensus earnings.\n  Listed Agri-tech exposure - We believe China big tech platforms with their investments in the space offer an option for public market investors. Note, most of the investments have been in eGrocery or marketplace deals rather than upstream technology. While not a pure play, they could benefit from increasing meat/alt meat consumption in China. These platforms are Tencent, Pinduoduo, Alibaba, Baidu, Meituan and Didi.\n  Further reading #    Huawei enters smart pig farming   With Huawei predicting its mobile shipments could fall 60% this year, the company has made a surprising turn – into the pig farming business.\n  Many tech firms globally are getting into the food production business and in China this is especially relevant, as food shortages are a major fear because of endemic livestock problems […]\n  The State Council Information Office held a press conference on Monday February 22 introduce moves to revitalise and ramp up agricultural and rural modernisation […]\n   AI assisted pig farming   In China, 98% of pork farms have fewer than 50 animals, and account for about a third of the country’s pork production. These highly decentralised farms make government oversight difficult. There is also enormous pressure on them to keep to the market price for pork, and to maintain steady production. The government was using ASF as a convenient excuse to eradicate these small farms, making way for centralised, industrial-scale operations.\n "},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/quant/quant_3/","title":"What Can We Glean From Company Filings (Without Actually Reading Them)?","section":"Quant","content":"What Can We Glean From Company Filings (Without Actually Reading Them)? #    Contents #    Plotting Change in Filings\n  Top Words by Salience\n  Sentiment Analysis\n  Takeaways\n   *Not investment advice. Do your own research.   Why You Should Read This Post #  Equity analysts have their plates full. Particularly during earnings season. While the quantitative analysis shown below cannot replicate the work of a good analyst, it can help one. During earnings season, one can take a quick glance \u0026ndash; particularly at the change scores \u0026ndash; to quickly determine which 10-Ks one should work through first. It can help an analyst rank order their stack of 10-Ks to read through.\n Exec Summary #  Company filings (e.g. 10-K, 10-Q, 20-F) can be dense and lengthy. For equity investors, it’s not easy getting through them. Are there any methods we can apply to prioritise which filings to read first and identify what to keep an eye on, all before actually digging in and reading them? This issue we sift through Apple’s 10-K filings at the SEC as a case study.\n Using change scores between a company\u0026rsquo;s year-on-year filings (see chart above), at a glance one can determine whether something has changed. The changers may warrant special attention over the non-changers.\n 1. Plotting Change in Filings #  We first extract one of the sections of most interest — “Item 7: Management Discussion \u0026amp; Analysis” — and try to quantify the year-on-year change.\n Our change score is a textual (word composition \u0026amp; frequency) comparison of the section from one year to the year prior. For example, a data point for 2020 indicates the scoring of the 2020 filing versus the 2019 filing. A score == 0 means no change (likely comparing the same document). At a glance, the change score answers the question \u0026ldquo;Did something change?\u0026rdquo; or “Should this be the first filing I read?.\nIn the case of AAPL, it’s clear that something was already afoot in 2005 and again in 2006, all before the spike in 2007. Jobs only announced the iPhone on Jan. 9, 2007 at the MacWorld Expo (source here)\n 2. Top Words by Salience #  We extract words from the filings and then score them based on their frequency within a particular 10-K versus their frequency in the company\u0026rsquo;s other 10-Ks. The point is to try to identify words that are rare (so they don\u0026rsquo;t show up high in frequency counts) but which could be significant in the context of a particular filing. The words are stemmed, e.g. \u0026ldquo;fraud\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;fraudulent\u0026rdquo; are treated the same as their common stem is \u0026ldquo;fraud\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;restructur\u0026rdquo; is the stem of \u0026ldquo;restructure\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;restructuring\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;restructured\u0026rdquo;, which all are semantically similar. Wearables become a thing in 2019 and 2020.\n And here are the salience scores for the words from the above table. Just to illustrate, the top_1 word in 1999 has a score of 69.90, meaning it doesn’t really show up anywhere else, what’s so special about it? Go back up and find that it corresponds to word “y2k”, i.e. the year 2000 when humanity was kind of panicking whether computer clocks would blow up going into 2000. Another example, 2007, very exceptional MD\u0026amp;A section versus Apple’s other filings; mostly about compensation to Jobs for pulling it all off? (iPhone announced January, filing filed end of September).\n  3. Sentiment Analysis #  Here we use the Loughran \u0026amp; McDonald Master Dictionary, a finance specific dictionary with codings for sentiment. Just for flavour, see lower down for sample list of words for the sentiment codings.\n Some observations:\n  Litigious wording increased strongly going into the 2000s before slope of trend abated somewhat after;\n  Negative wording fell sharply after 2005;\n  Strong wordings have their 1-3 year periods of surfacing now and then;\n  Uncertainty wordings for the company bottomed in 2007 and remained incredibly steady thereafter. Again, after the release of the iPhone things became more certain, which is reflected in the textual discussions in the 10-K.\n   "},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/tidbits/tidbit_3/","title":"What's Changed in China's Marriage Patterns?","section":"Tidbits","content":"What\u0026rsquo;s Changed in China\u0026rsquo;s Marriage Patterns? #    Contents #    Hypergamy: What Is It?\n  The Reversal of a Trend\n  So What?\n    The Setup #  China has experienced unprecedented economic growth since its reforms in the 1980s. But how has this impacted its marriage patterns?\n 1. Hypergamy: What Is It? #  Hypergamy is a fancy word for the tendency in humans for men to mate across and down the socio-economic hierarchy, whereas women mate across and up. Hypergamy can be mediated through education, age, or general socio-economic status.\n You’ll notice that past a certain point on the image above, women will not partner with males of sufficiently low status. One of the reasons for why the human species evolved so rapidly is precisely due to, not just natural selection pressures which impacts all species, but to female selection. In comparison, chimpanzee females are non-discriminatory maters. More on the biology here.\nWomen are choosy of their mates along a variety of dimensions. Most notably, women prefer men with a higher capacity to: (A) generate wealth; (B) share it. This is different to men just possessing wealth because that’s ephemeral and that inheritance can be gone tomorrow. More on these studies here.\nHypergamy is a strong enough phenomenon to be observed across cultures, including arguably the most gender-equal society in the world — Norway:\n We have outlined theoretical foundations for the existence of hypergamy and we have presented overwhelming empirical evidence that hypergamy is an important feature of mating patterns in Norway. (Source: “The Economics of Hypergamy”, Almås et al. 2019)\n  2. The Reversal of a Trend? #  So what’s happened in China? Hypergamy has made a U-turn.\n  From Mu and Xie (2014):\n In the pre-reform [China] regime, almost all domains of life, including employment, consumption, housing, and even family life, were largely regulated by the state in order to operationalise Communist egalitarian ideology. Consequently, inequality was low and economic expectations were highly limited. However, the reform has dramatically altered the context. […]\n  [After the reforms] while women may want to marry older men in response to their occupational downgrades, men may want to settle down later given the labor and marriage market competition they face.\n  […] We tested the plausible ‘‘economic pressure’’ explanation that the post-1990s reform era environment – with its intensified labor market pressure, rising consumerism, and skyrocketing costs of living – acted to promote marriages of older men to younger women on the basis of a need or preference for status hypergamy. Simply put, a renewed interest in status hypergamy is thought to be driven by men’s increasing economic pressures to support family consumption and women’s downgraded labor market prospects.\n  In particular, given women’s educational advances in reform-era China, status hypergamy is more difficult to achieve among like-aged men and women, who may have similar educational attainment and be at similar career points. Our tests of the relative impact of age and education on status hypergamy support the premise that age has begun to substitute for education as a proxy for men’s higher status [emphasis added]. In this sense, our analysis found the closing of the gender gap in educational attainment to also be a plausible causal mechanism of the reversal in age homogamy in the post- 1990s reform era.\n  3. So What? #  The point is that it’s possible to quantify economic pressure across societies and time. We find that pretty neat. Others may not.\nAs a rule of thumb then, the larger the prevalence of hypergamy in a society (as exhibited in the husband-wife age gap), the greater the economic pressures (on both genders). It takes time for males to establish themselves in a society after reaching adulthood — education, skill acquisition, work experience all play into this. The more years it takes to build enough competence before being able to provide a surplus for dependents in a complex society, the higher this measure of economic pressure. We write “dependents” because no matter how you slice it, childbearing is a prolonged period of dependency for both female and child in terms of resources needed. Given that on average a single income per family isn’t sufficient even with mild hypergamy, this leads to strains on and engenders new dynamics in the whole family unit.\nIn the case of China, this trend reversed around 1995. Arguably, it’s likely that this is one of the undercurrents that’s cutting across various themes in the country, declining birth rates and unmarried low status males being just two of them.\n"}]
